# data-warehouse-cloud-content-beta
Use the Bikes Sales sample content to explore SAP Data Warehouse Cloud during the beta phase. The download contains a data model file for a SAP HANA 2.x to consume the sample data remotely from your SAP HANA CSV files in case you want to start without a SAP HANA.

# Requirements
To use the content, you must be part of the beta Program for SAP Data Warehousing Cloud. Details can be found on our [website](https://www.sapdatawarehouse.cloud) here.
If you want to use your SAP HANA as a remote source with the content, you need a SAP HANA 2.x release
Of course any HANA 1.x release can be used with SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, but the sample can currently only be imported into SAP HANA 2.x
